# Financial Loan Data Analysis

## Introduction
  
This project goes through my process of analyzing 200,000 observations of car accidents in the city of Chicago.  In particular, I wanted to try and identify if there were any notable factors that were contributing to higher probabilities of injuries in these car accidents.  While not every city is the same, I believe some of these generalizations can be applied to driving conditions all over America to help us get a little bit more insight on what leads to car accidents & related injuries and how we keep ourselves as protected as possible.

## The Data
The dataset comes from the [City of Chicago](https://data.cityofchicago.org/), where they offer an API to search for and extract various data from a number of their different departments.  For this project I chose to select all car accident report data from January 7th, 2019 to January 7th, 2021.  2 years of sample size gave me the right amount of data I felt comfortable working with, and was more than enough to help find meaningful insights.

Below are the 15 variables I chose to select for all of my analysis.

Categorical Variables      | Continuous Variables
